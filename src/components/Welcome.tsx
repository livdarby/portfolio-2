                  I'm Liv, a Junior Developer based in Perth, Western Australia.
                  A little bit about me... I was born and raised in the United
                  Kingdom, where I grew up on a small farm in the West Midlands.
                  I've had a love for the outdoors from an early age and I now
                  find every opportunity to get into nature, from hiking in the
                  Lake District, to biking in the Dolomites, to living out of a
                  tentbox on a Defender 90.

                  I studied Environment, Law & Economics at the University of
                  Cambridge and after graduating, I moved to Australia for a
                  year on a working holiday visa. As clich√© as it sounds, I fell
                  in love with the country, beaches and lifestyle, and always
                  dreamed of coming back.
                </p>
                <p className="my-2">
                  After a year abroad, I moved back to England, where I started
                  working for LTK (rewardStyle), a creator monetisation platform
                  based in London, where I had the pleasure of working with
                  incredible creators and brands like Nike, Charlotte Tilbury
                  and Selfridges.

                  After a wonderful four years at LTK, where I segued from
                  Account Management to Business Development, I started working
                  at CJ, an affiliate marketing network. I worked closely with
                  client tech teams to integrate their tracking technology, and
                  was given a new insight into the world of web development. The
                  challenge of learning new concepts, logical problem-solving
                  and team dynamic piqued my interest and were elements I felt I
                  was missing in my Business Development role.

                  After 18 months at CJ, I decided to pursue my interest in tech
                  and completed a 3-month Software Engineering bootcamp with
                  General Assembly. It was the best decision - I fell in love
                  with coding and built a solid foundation in front-end and
                  back-end frameworks. The course simulated a real work
                  environment with daily standups, joint and solo projects, and
                  pair programming.

              Since graduating from General Assembly, I've been freelancing for
              a UK Fantasy Premier League company, FPL BlackBox, developing
              their predictions site from scratch. During this time, I have also
              emigrated to Perth and am looking for full-time work as a Junior
              Developer.
